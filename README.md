# Assistance with cleaning the dataset

I intend to answer the question 'What Census data is most associated with high gun per capita ?' and the column that will be useful in helping me answering this question is the 'fact' column however that column has 65 rows after the cleaning process. Please how can I drill down to the row that will be most import in answering my questions as I can't go through each one by by one.

Please have a look.
